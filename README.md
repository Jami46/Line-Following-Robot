# Line-Following-Robot
Summary: This project involves programming a microcontroller (like Arduino or STM32) to control a robot that follows a line. The robot uses infrared sensors to detect the line and adjust its motors to follow it. The project includes:

Initialization of sensors and motors.
A feedback loop that adjusts motor speed based on sensor input.
Calibration and edge-case handling for smooth operation.
